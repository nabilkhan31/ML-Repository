#### Machine learning course from which I learned different types of regression using the libraries numpy, matplotlib and pandas
##### This course expanded my knowledge in machine learning by predicting future values for variables like salaries. The course dove deep into the theory of these functions we were using. It also taught me how to clean data properly, for example, filling in missing values, feature scaling, splitting the data into the training set and the test set, and encoding categorical data.
##### I also learned how to plot values onto a graph and show clearly the relationship between different variables.
